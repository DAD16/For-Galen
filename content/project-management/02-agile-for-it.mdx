# Agile Methods for IT Teams

Traditional "waterfall" project management — plan everything upfront, execute in order — works fine when requirements are clear and stable. But IT projects rarely are. Agile gives you a framework to adapt as you go, delivering value in small increments instead of one big bang at the end.

## Why Agile for IT Operations?

You're not a software development shop, so why Agile? Because your work shares the same characteristics:

- **Requirements change constantly** — the business pivots, a new security requirement lands, a vendor changes their API
- **You can't predict everything** — that "simple" server migration turns into a DNS nightmare
- **Users need results fast** — waiting 6 months for a perfect solution while they struggle with workarounds
- **You learn as you go** — the first week of any project reveals things you didn't know in planning

## Agile vs. Waterfall: A Real Example

**Scenario:** Migrate 200 users from on-prem Exchange to Microsoft 365.

**Waterfall approach:**
1. Plan the entire migration (4 weeks)
2. Build and configure the M365 tenant (3 weeks)
3. Migrate all users at once over a weekend (1 weekend)
4. Fix all the issues (??? weeks)

**Agile approach:**
1. Sprint 1: Set up M365 tenant, migrate IT team (5 people) — learn from it
2. Sprint 2: Migrate one small department (15 people) — refine the process
3. Sprint 3: Migrate two more departments (40 people) — scale up
4. Sprint 4-6: Migrate remaining departments in batches — apply lessons learned
5. Sprint 7: Decommission old Exchange server

The Agile approach catches problems early (when 5 people are affected, not 200), builds confidence, and lets you refine the process with each batch.

## Kanban for IT Operations

Kanban is the most natural Agile method for IT teams because it maps directly to how IT work already flows.

### Setting Up Your Board

Use the Projects feature in this platform to create a kanban board with these columns:

| Column | What Goes Here |
|---|---|
| **Backlog** | All incoming requests, ideas, and planned work |
| **To Do** | Work committed for this week/sprint |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on |
| **Waiting** | Blocked — waiting on vendor, approval, user, etc. |
| **Review** | Done but needs testing or approval |
| **Done** | Completed and verified |

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

The most powerful Kanban concept: **limit how many items can be in progress at once.**

If your IT team has 3 people, set a WIP limit of 3-5 for the "In Progress" column. This forces you to:

- **Finish work** before starting new work
- **Identify bottlenecks** — if the "Waiting" column keeps growing, that's a systemic issue
- **Reduce context switching** — the #1 productivity killer for IT teams

### Prioritization with Classes of Service

Not all IT work is equal. Classify incoming requests:

| Class | Examples | Response Time |
|---|---|---|
| **Expedite** | Security incident, system outage, executive escalation | Drop everything |
| **High** | Server patching, compliance deadlines, blocked users | This week |
| **Standard** | Feature requests, process improvements, documentation | This sprint |
| **Low** | Nice-to-haves, research, optimization | When capacity allows |

## Sprints for IT Projects

A sprint is a fixed time period (usually 1-2 weeks) where you commit to completing specific work.

### Sprint Planning

Every Monday (or your chosen start day):

1. **Review the backlog** — what's most important right now?
2. **Estimate effort** — use T-shirt sizes (S/M/L/XL) instead of hours
3. **Commit to a sprint goal** — "This week we'll complete the VPN migration for the sales team"
4. **Assign owners** — every task has one person responsible

### Daily Standups (15 minutes max)

Three questions, go around the team:

1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. Am I blocked on anything?

**IT manager tip:** If you have a small team (2-4 people), a daily Slack check-in works just as well as a meeting. Save meetings for when someone is blocked.

### Sprint Review & Retrospective

At the end of each sprint:

**Review (30 min):** What did we deliver? Demo completed work to stakeholders if applicable.

**Retrospective (30 min):** Answer three questions as a team:
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What will we change next sprint?

## Agile Metrics That Matter

### For the Team

- **Cycle Time** — how long does a task take from "To Do" to "Done"?
- **Throughput** — how many tasks completed per sprint?
- **WIP Age** — how long have current in-progress items been there? (Items older than 2x your average cycle time are red flags)

### For Leadership

- **Sprint Goal Completion** — did you achieve what you committed to? (Aim for 80%+)
- **Blocked Time** — how much time was spent waiting vs. working?
- **Unplanned Work Ratio** — what percentage of sprint work was unplanned? (If >40%, your planning needs work)

## Common Pitfalls for IT Teams

### 1. "We're too busy for process"
If you're too busy to plan, you're too busy *not* to plan. Start small — a kanban board and a 15-minute Monday planning session.

### 2. "Everything is urgent"
If everything is urgent, nothing is. Use classes of service and force prioritization. Escalate to your manager if leadership won't prioritize.

### 3. "Agile means no planning"
Wrong. Agile means *adaptive* planning. You still plan — you just plan in smaller increments and adjust as you learn.

### 4. "We tried it and it didn't work"
Agile is a mindset, not a set of meetings. If standups feel pointless, they're too long or unfocused. If sprint planning is a chore, your backlog isn't maintained. Fix the practice, not the framework.

## Getting Started This Week

1. **Create a kanban board** — use the Projects feature right here. Set up columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Waiting, Done
2. **Dump everything on it** — every task, request, and project your team is tracking. Get it all visible
3. **Set WIP limits** — start with: number of team members + 1
4. **Schedule a 15-minute Monday planning session** — pick the top items for the week
5. **At Friday end-of-day** — move completed items to Done, note what got stuck and why
