# Project Management Fundamentals for IT Managers

As an IT manager, you're constantly juggling projects — software rollouts, system migrations, infrastructure upgrades, process improvements. This module gives you a practical PM framework you can apply immediately, without the certification jargon.

## The IT Project Reality

IT projects are different from other projects because:

- **Technology changes fast** — requirements may shift mid-project
- **Dependencies are complex** — one system change affects many others
- **Stakeholders have varied technical understanding** — you bridge the gap between technical teams and business users
- **"Done" is hard to define** — unlike building a house, software and systems evolve continuously

## The Five Core PM Areas

### 1. Scope: What Are We Actually Doing?

The #1 reason IT projects fail is **scope creep** — the project grows beyond what was originally planned.

**How to define scope clearly:**

- Write a one-paragraph **project statement**: "We are migrating from [old system] to [new system] for [these users] by [this date], including [these features]."
- Create an **in/out list**: two columns listing what IS included and what is NOT
- Get **written sign-off** from your sponsor before starting

**Example scope statement:**
> "We are migrating the sales team (35 users) from the legacy CRM to Salesforce by March 31. This includes contact and opportunity data migration, basic training, and standard report setup. This does NOT include custom Apex development, marketing automation integration, or historical data older than 2 years."

### 2. Schedule: When Will Things Happen?

**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**
Break every project into phases, then tasks, then subtasks:

```
Phase 1: Planning (Week 1-2)
  ├── Define requirements with stakeholders
  ├── Map data from legacy system to Salesforce fields
  ├── Create migration test plan
  └── Set up Salesforce sandbox

Phase 2: Build (Week 3-5)
  ├── Configure Salesforce objects and fields
  ├── Build data transformation scripts
  ├── Create user roles and permissions
  └── Build standard reports and dashboards

Phase 3: Test (Week 6-7)
  ├── Migrate sample data to sandbox
  ├── User acceptance testing (UAT)
  ├── Fix issues found in UAT
  └── Prepare training materials

Phase 4: Deploy (Week 8)
  ├── Final data migration
  ├── User training sessions
  ├── Go-live support
  └── Post-migration validation
```

**Estimation tip:** Take your best estimate and add 30% buffer for IT projects. Things always take longer than expected due to unexpected issues, vendor delays, and competing priorities.

### 3. Budget: What Will It Cost?

IT project costs typically include:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Software/Licenses** | Salesforce licenses, migration tools, testing tools |
| **People** | Internal staff time, contractors, consultants |
| **Infrastructure** | Servers, cloud services, network upgrades |
| **Training** | Materials, trainer time, user downtime |
| **Contingency** | 10-15% of total budget for unknowns |

**Pro tip:** Track actual vs. planned costs weekly. Small overruns caught early are easy to manage; large overruns discovered late are project-killers.

### 4. Risk: What Could Go Wrong?

For every IT project, create a simple risk register:

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data loss during migration | Medium | Critical | Full backup before migration, test restore procedure |
| Users resist new system | High | High | Early involvement, training plan, executive sponsor communication |
| Integration with Fishbowl breaks | Medium | High | Test in sandbox, have rollback plan ready |
| Key team member unavailable | Medium | Medium | Document procedures, cross-train team |
| Vendor delivers late | Medium | High | Build buffer into schedule, have contingency plan |

### 5. Communication: Who Needs to Know What?

**Communication plan template:**

| Audience | What They Need | Frequency | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| Executive sponsor | High-level status, decisions needed | Weekly | 1-page email summary |
| Project team | Detailed tasks, blockers, next steps | Daily/Weekly | Stand-up or team meeting |
| End users | Timeline, training schedule, what's changing | Bi-weekly | Email update or town hall |
| IT leadership | Budget status, risks, resource needs | Weekly | Dashboard or report |

## Your PM Toolkit

Here are tools you already have access to that work great for project management:

- **This platform's Project Tracker** — use it for task management and kanban boards
- **Excel** — for budget tracking, risk registers, and status reports
- **Claude Code** — to generate project plans, status reports, and templates
- **Salesforce** — for tracking project-related tasks if you use it for internal ops

## Quick Start: Your Next Project

Right now, think about an upcoming project. Answer these five questions:

1. **What** is the project delivering? (Scope)
2. **When** does it need to be done? (Schedule)
3. **How much** will it cost in time and money? (Budget)
4. **What could** go wrong? (Risk)
5. **Who** needs to know about it? (Communication)

Write these answers down — you've just created a project brief.

## What's Next

In the following modules, we'll cover:
- **Agile for IT Teams** — applying Agile and Kanban to IT operations
- **Stakeholder Communication** — presenting to executives and managing expectations
- **PM Tools & Templates** — practical templates you can use immediately
