## Risk Register Template

Track project risks in a simple spreadsheet or table:

| ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Vendor delivers integration late | High | High | Critical | Build 2-week buffer; identify backup vendor | Galen | Open |
| R2 | Key team member on PTO during migration | Medium | High | High | Cross-train backup person before PTO | Galen | Mitigated |
| R3 | Users resist new system | High | Medium | High | Early involvement; training; executive sponsor comms | Galen | Open |
| R4 | Data migration has quality issues | Medium | Medium | Medium | Validate sample data first; automate validation checks | IT Team | Open |
| R5 | Budget overrun on licenses | Low | Medium | Low | Get firm quote upfront; negotiate multi-year discount | Galen | Closed |

**Risk Score Guide:**
- **Likelihood × Impact** → Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Review weekly in sprint planning
- Close risks that no longer apply or have been fully mitigated

## Change Request Template

## Using Claude Code for Templates

You can generate customized versions of any template instantly:

```bash
claude "Create a project brief for migrating our file server to SharePoint Online. Our company has 200 users, 2TB of files, and we need it done in 6 weeks. The budget is $25,000. Key risk: users are used to mapped drives and will resist the change."
```

```bash
claude "Generate a risk register for a Salesforce-to-Fishbowl integration project. We're a mid-size distribution company with 3 IT staff. The integration needs to sync sales orders in near real-time."
```

```bash
claude "Write a change request for adding mobile access to our project scope. Original scope was desktop-only Salesforce implementation. Adding mobile will need an additional 2 weeks and $3,000 for mobile licenses."
```

## Practical Exercise

1. **Fill out a project brief** for an upcoming or current project using the template above
2. **Write your first weekly status report** — even if it's just for yourself, the discipline of summarizing weekly is valuable
3. **Build a risk register** with at least 5 risks for your current biggest project
4. **Run a retrospective** at your next team meeting — even if you haven't been "doing Agile," reflect on what went well and what didn't
