# Getting Started with Claude Code

Welcome, Galen! This module will get you up and running with Claude Code — a powerful AI-powered command-line tool that can dramatically speed up your IT management tasks.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI (command-line interface) for Claude. Unlike the web chat, Claude Code can:

- **Read and write files** on your computer
- **Run commands** in your terminal
- **Search through codebases** and documents
- **Generate scripts, reports, and documents** based on your instructions
- **Automate repetitive tasks** that eat into your day

As an IT manager working with Excel, Salesforce, Fishbowl, and various documents, Claude Code becomes your most powerful productivity tool.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Claude Code requires Node.js 18 or later. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and run the installer.

Verify the installation by opening your terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see something like `v20.x.x` or higher.

### Step 2: Install Claude Code

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Step 3: Authenticate

Run Claude Code for the first time:

```bash
claude
```

Follow the prompts to connect your Anthropic account. You'll need an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

## Your First Commands

Once authenticated, try these commands that are directly relevant to your work:

### Ask a Quick Question

```bash
claude "What's the Excel formula to count unique values in column A?"
```

### Generate a Document

```bash
claude "Create a standard operating procedure template for onboarding new software users"
```

### Get Salesforce Help

```bash
claude "Write a SOQL query to find all active contacts who haven't been updated in 90 days"
```

## How Claude Code Fits Your Role

As an IT Manager, here's how Claude Code maps to your daily work:

| Your Task | How Claude Code Helps |
|---|---|
| Excel spreadsheets | Generates complex formulas, VBA macros, data cleaning scripts |
| Salesforce admin | Writes SOQL queries, explains configurations, generates reports |
| Fishbowl operations | Helps with data exports, integration scripts, workflow documentation |
| User documentation | Creates SOPs, guides, and templates in seconds |
| Project planning | Breaks down projects, creates timelines, writes status reports |

## Key Tips for IT Managers

1. **Be specific about your context.** Instead of "help with Excel", say "I have a spreadsheet with employee names in column A and departments in column B. I need a formula that..."

2. **Tell Claude about your tools.** Mention that you're using Salesforce, Fishbowl, or specific Excel versions so it gives relevant answers.

3. **Ask for step-by-step instructions.** Claude Code excels at breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps.

4. **Review before applying.** Always check generated formulas, queries, or scripts before using them on production data.

- **Excel automation** — formulas, macros, and data processing
- **Salesforce administration** — queries, reports, and user management
