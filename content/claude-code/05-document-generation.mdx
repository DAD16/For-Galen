# Document Generation & Templates

As an IT manager, you constantly create documents — SOPs, user guides, change requests, status reports, post-mortems. Claude Code turns document creation from a multi-hour task into a multi-minute one while keeping everything consistent and professional.

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Creating an SOP from Scratch

```bash
claude "Write a Standard Operating Procedure for our IT department's new employee onboarding process. Include these steps:
1. Account creation (Active Directory, email, Salesforce, Fishbowl)
2. Hardware setup (laptop, monitors, peripherals)
3. Software installation (standard stack: Office 365, Slack, VPN, antivirus)
4. Security training enrollment
5. First-week orientation checklist

Format it with: Document ID, Version, Effective Date, Department, Purpose, Scope, Responsibilities, Procedure (numbered steps with sub-steps), and Revision History table."
```

### Updating an Existing SOP

```bash
claude "Here's our current password reset SOP:
[paste existing SOP text]

Update it to include:
1. A new self-service password reset option via Microsoft SSPR
2. MFA enrollment requirements
3. Special handling for service accounts
4. Escalation path for locked-out executives
Keep the same format and numbering style."
```

## User Guides

### End-User Software Guide

```bash
claude "Write a user guide for our non-technical staff explaining how to use the new VPN client. Assume the audience has basic computer skills. Include:
1. What is a VPN and why we use it
2. Installing the VPN client (Windows and Mac)
3. Connecting to the VPN (with screenshots descriptions)
4. Troubleshooting common issues (connection drops, slow speed, can't reach internal sites)
5. When you need to use VPN vs when you don't
Keep it friendly and jargon-free. Add a Quick Reference card at the end."
```

### Admin Configuration Guide

```bash
claude "Write a technical guide for IT staff on configuring our Salesforce SSO integration with Azure Active Directory. Include:
1. Prerequisites (Azure AD Premium, Salesforce Enterprise Edition)
2. Azure AD app registration steps
3. SAML configuration in Salesforce
4. User attribute mapping
5. Testing the SSO connection
6. Troubleshooting failed logins
7. Rollback procedure if SSO breaks
Target audience: junior IT admins who know Salesforce but are new to Azure AD."
```

## Status Reports & Updates

### Weekly IT Status Report

```bash
claude "Generate a template for a weekly IT status report that covers:
1. Executive Summary (3-4 bullet points)
2. Projects Update (table with: Project, Status RAG, % Complete, Key Milestones, Risks)
3. Incidents & Issues (table with: Ticket#, Priority, Description, Status, Owner)
4. Upcoming Week (key activities and deadlines)
5. Resource Requests (if any)
6. Metrics (uptime %, tickets opened/closed, avg resolution time)

Make it concise — executives should be able to scan it in 2 minutes."
```

### Project Status Email

```bash
claude "Draft a status update email for the Fishbowl-to-Salesforce integration project. Here are the facts:
- Sprint 3 of 5 is complete
- API integration is working in staging
- We found a data mapping issue with product categories — adds 3 days
- UAT starts next week
- Budget is on track
- One risk: the Fishbowl API rate limit might be too low for full sync

Write it for the VP of Operations. Be honest about the delay but frame it constructively."
```

## Change Management Documents

### Change Request Form

```bash
claude "Create a change request template for IT infrastructure changes. Include:
1. Change Request ID and Date
2. Requester information
3. Change Description (what, why, how)
4. Risk Assessment (impact level, probability, mitigation)
5. Implementation Plan (steps, timeline, resources needed)
6. Rollback Plan
7. Testing Requirements
8. Approval chain (IT Manager, Security, Department Head)
9. Post-implementation review checklist

Format it as a form with fill-in fields."
```

### Post-Incident Report

```bash
claude "Write a post-incident report template and fill it in with this scenario:
- Incident: Email server went down for 2.5 hours on Tuesday morning
- Cause: A Windows update caused the Exchange service to crash
- Detection: Users reported at 8:15 AM, confirmed by monitoring at 8:20 AM
- Resolution: Rolled back the update, service restored at 10:45 AM
- Impact: 200 users couldn't send/receive email for 2.5 hours during peak hours

Include: Timeline, Root Cause Analysis, Impact Assessment, Corrective Actions (with owners and due dates), and Lessons Learned."
```

## Batch Document Generation

### Multiple Documents at Once

```bash
claude "I need to generate individualized system access request forms for 5 new hires starting next Monday. For each person, create a form with their name and pre-fill the standard software stack. Here are the new hires:
1. Maria Santos - Marketing Coordinator (needs: Office 365, Salesforce read-only, Slack, Canva)
2. Tom Wright - Warehouse Supervisor (needs: Office 365, Fishbowl full access, Slack, warehouse scanner app)
3. Lisa Park - Sales Rep (needs: Office 365, Salesforce full access, Slack, DocuSign, LinkedIn Sales Navigator)
4. James Reed - IT Support Technician (needs: full admin stack)
5. Ana Chen - Accountant (needs: Office 365, Fishbowl read-only, QuickBooks, Slack)"
```

## Practical Exercise

Create these documents for your actual environment:

1. **SOP** — Pick a process your team does regularly but hasn't documented yet. Have Claude write the first draft
2. **User guide** — Think of the last thing users asked you to explain. Turn it into a proper guide
3. **Status report** — Generate next week's status report template pre-filled with your current projects
4. **Change request** — Document an upcoming change you've been planning

## Tips for Document Generation

- **Provide real context** — the more specific details you give Claude, the more useful the output
- **Specify the audience** — "for executives" produces very different documents than "for junior IT staff"
- **Ask for formatting** — request specific formats (Markdown, HTML, plain text) to match your tools
- **Iterate and refine** — treat the first output as a draft; ask Claude to adjust tone, add sections, or simplify
- **Maintain a template library** — save your best Claude-generated templates for reuse
- **Include your company's terminology** — mention specific system names, team names, and processes
