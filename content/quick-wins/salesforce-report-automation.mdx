# Automate Salesforce Report Generation

Stop clicking through the Salesforce Report Builder for routine reports. Claude Code can generate the exact SOQL query or report configuration you need in seconds.

## The Problem

Building a custom Salesforce report the traditional way:
1. Navigate to Reports → New Report
2. Pick a report type (is it Contacts & Accounts? Or Accounts with Contacts?)
3. Add filters one by one
4. Group rows and columns
5. Add summary formulas
6. Save, run, realize it's wrong, edit, repeat

**With Claude Code:** Describe what you want in plain English, get the SOQL query immediately.

## Quick Wins

### Pipeline Report

```bash
claude "Write a SOQL query for a Salesforce pipeline report showing all open Opportunities grouped by Stage. Include: Opportunity Name, Account Name, Amount, Close Date, and Owner. Sort by Close Date ascending. Only include opportunities closing this quarter."
```

Result:

```sql
SELECT Name, Account.Name, Amount, CloseDate, Owner.Name, StageName
FROM Opportunity
WHERE IsClosed = false
AND CloseDate = THIS_FISCAL_QUARTER
ORDER BY CloseDate ASC
```

### Overdue Tasks

```bash
claude "SOQL query to find all overdue Tasks in Salesforce — where ActivityDate is in the past and Status is not 'Completed'. Include the task subject, who it's assigned to, the related account, and how many days overdue it is."
```

### Inactive Users Costing You Licenses

```bash
claude "SOQL query to find Salesforce users who are active (consuming a license) but haven't logged in for 90+ days. Include their name, email, profile, and last login date. This is for our quarterly license audit."
```

### Account Health Check

```bash
claude "Write a SOQL query that finds Accounts with no Activity (Tasks or Events) in the last 60 days but have open Opportunities. These are at-risk deals — we have pipeline but no recent engagement."
```

## Going Beyond SOQL

### Report Type Guidance

```bash
claude "I need a Salesforce report that shows the number of Cases opened per month for the last 12 months, broken down by Case Origin (Email, Phone, Web). What report type should I use, and what are the exact steps to build it in the Report Builder?"
```

### Dashboard Component

```bash
claude "I need a dashboard chart showing our sales pipeline as a funnel — Prospecting at the top down to Closed Won at the bottom. Give me the steps to create this in Salesforce, including the underlying report I need first."
```

## Try It Now

1. Think of a report you pull regularly from Salesforce
2. Describe it to Claude in plain English
3. Get the SOQL query and try it in Developer Console or Workbench
4. Save it as a Salesforce report for one-click access going forward

**Time saved:** What used to take 15-30 minutes of clicking through the Report Builder now takes 30 seconds of describing what you want.
